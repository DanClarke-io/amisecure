iOS App to check the haveibeenpwned.com API.

This app makes a call to the [API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breaches) and displays all breaches as a list, allowing you to find out information for each one

## Next steps
I plan to make it able to search your email address/username on the system and return the information, as the website does.

I also plan to allow the system to alert you should your username/email become compromised, such as after a breach. This should be as a iOS notification.

### Thanks
Thanks to [Troy Hunt](https://github.com/troyhunt) for all of his work on the haveibeenpwned system, and allowing it to be free for anyone to use.
